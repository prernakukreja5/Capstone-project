# Capstone-project
Real-time dynamic pricing for parking lots using Pathway and Bokeh. Automatically adjusts prices based on demand, with live interactive visualizations.
Dynamic Parking Pricing with Real-Time Data
Dynamic Parking Pricing System

Overview  
This project implements a dynamic pricing system for parking lots that adjusts prices in real time based on demand. Two pricing models are used to calculate optimal prices, and interactive visualizations are provided to justify pricing changes.

Tech Stack  
- Python 3  
- Google Colab  
- Bokeh (for interactive visualizations)  
- NumPy, Pandas (for data processing)

Project Architecture and Workflow  
- Input real-time or simulated parking demand data  
- Calculate demand scores for each parking lot  
- Apply two pricing models to determine dynamic prices  
- Visualize price changes over time using Bokeh  
- Use visualizations to justify pricing decisions based on demand

Usage  
- Open the Google Colab notebook  
- Run all cells to simulate pricing and generate visualizations  
- Refer to the PDF report for detailed analysis

Documentation  
- The Colab notebook contains all code and interactive plots  
- The PDF report summarizes methodology and results
